# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
3.1.3

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* This is the beginning of a To-Do list style app using Ruby on Rails, TailwindCSS, Postgresql, and Stimulus with Turbo Frames. During the creation of this app I have learned more about Ruby on Rails, TailwindCss and Stimulus. 

I am hoping to take what I learned from in this project to my next project which will be similar but have user authentication and authorization.
